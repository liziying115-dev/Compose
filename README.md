# TECHIN 509: Problem Definition


This assignment aims to get you started with final project. You will get familiar with Markdown, and practice our discussion on version control. In this assignment, you will practice
- Writing sturctured document in Markdown
- Using Git for version control
- Publishing your work on GitHub

## Instructions

### Practice Markdown

Read through the [tutorial on Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)

### Problem-Solving using Python

Imagine you will build a simple music composer using Python. This composer is a Python program that can create simple melodies automatically.
**You are not required to write any code.**
Instead, you’ll brainstorm and document your design ideas in a Markdown file, and practice using Git and GitHub to manage your work.

- Create a local repo and add a `README.md`
- In `README.md`, document your solution idea to build music composer. Use headings, buleet points, code blocks wherever appropriate. Your document should be cleanly formatted and easy to follow.
- Think of this problem in a modularized way. The following prompts may guide your thinking:
    - **Input**:
      - What information does the program need to start?
      - Shall the program request input from users? Make a case for your answer rather than simply give yes or no.
    - **Output**:
      - What does the program produce?
      - What the generated music might look like, e.g., figures, excel spreadsheet, plain text?
    - **Representation:**
      - How should the program represent notes? Some examples might include letters (C, D, E), numbers (music signal frequencies), strings (C4 quarter note).
      - How to capture/represent time duration of music notes?
    - **Logic:**
      - How could the program decide what note comes next?
      - How does the program know when to terminate music generation?
    - **Extensions:**
      - What are blockers for generating longer piece of music?

**Note**: We do not grade this submission based on correctness. But you **should justify your answers.**
